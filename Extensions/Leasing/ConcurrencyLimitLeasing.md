# Max Concurrency Limit Leasing Strategy Extension

_This extension specification is currently incubating.  While incubating the version is 0._

## Introduction
Lease provide a powerful mechanism for `Server` to control it's stability. However, one common strategy for Leasing may not be efficient for all the cases. A common mechanism for authenticating is using a bearer token. Requests Concurrency Limit is a well-know mechanism in order to achieve optimal throughput with optimal latency. This Lease Strategy provides a standardized mechanism for negotiating Concurrency Limit using [Leasing Frame][lf].

* __Frame Type__: (6 bits) 0x02 
* __Flags__: (10 bits)
     * (__M__)etadata: Metadata present
* __Time-To-Live (TTL)__: (31 bits = max value 2^31-1 = 2,147,483,647) Unsigned 31-bit integer of Time (in milliseconds) for validity of LEASE from time of reception. Value MUST be > 0.
* __Concurrency Limit__: (31 bits = max value 2^31-1 = 2,147,483,647) Unsigned 31-bit long of Number of Max Concurrent Requests at a time. Value MUST be >= 0. 

A Responder implementation MAY stop all further requests by sending a LEASE with a value of 0 for __Concurrency Limit__.

When a LEASE expires due to time, the value of the __Concurrency Limit__ that a Requester may make is implicitly 0.

This frame only supports Metadata, so the Metadata Length header MUST NOT be included, even if the (M)etadata flag is set true.
